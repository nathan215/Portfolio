The objective of this program is to implement a few functionalities of a text processor.
A text processor allows users to manipulate a string of characters. These manipulations provide innumerable options with which to personalise a document.
For instance one can:
1. Change the alignment of the text so as to right align, left align, or justify (right and left align) it.
2. Perform global replacement of a certain string in the text with another string.
3. Keep track of the number of words and characters in the text.
4. Change the case (upper or lower) of a certain piece of text.
5. Print the text in various formats.
6. Count the number of appearances of a certain string in a text.
