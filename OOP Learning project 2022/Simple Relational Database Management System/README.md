# Simple Relational Database Management System
## Project Overview

This project is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) written in C++. The program is designed to store, manage, and retrieve data in a structured manner, providing the user with a flexible and efficient solution for managing large amounts of information.
## Features

- Store data in a structured manner using tables
- Implement basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) on data stored in tables
- Implement relationships between tables using foreign keys
- Support for transactions to ensure data consistency
- Provide a user-friendly interface for managing the data stored in the RDBMS

## Technique

This program utilizes object-oriented programming concepts and data structures such as linked lists and arrays to store and manage the data efficiently. The program also uses file input/output operations to persist the data between sessions, ensuring that the user's data remains safe even after the program terminates.

The program follows a modular design, which makes it easy to extend and add new features in the future. The code is written in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and maintain.
