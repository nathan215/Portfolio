# Deque
## Project Overview

This project consists of a C++ implementation of a Deque (Double Ended Queue) data structure. A deque is a linear collection that supports adding and removing elements from both ends. The implementation includes five files:

    Deque.h: header file that defines the interface for the Deque class
    Deque.cpp: implementation file that implements the Deque class
    main.cpp: main file that tests the implementation of the Deque class
    Deque_Iterator.h: header file that defines the Node class used by the Deque class
    Deque_Iterator: implementation file that implements the Node class used by the Deque class

## Features

The Deque class implements the following functionality:

    Adding elements to the front and back of the deque
    Removing elements from the front and back of the deque
    Checking if the deque is empty
    Returning the size of the deque

## Technique

The Deque implementation uses the following programming techniques:

    Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts such as class and object definition, inheritance, and polymorphism
    Linked list data structure to store the elements in the deque
    Templates to support elements of any data type in the deque
    Exception handling to handle scenarios such as removing elements from an empty deque.

The code is well-commented and follows good coding practices, making it easy to understand and modify.
